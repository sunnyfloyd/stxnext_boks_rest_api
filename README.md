# STXNEXT Interview Project

## Assumptions

- Initial data from Google Books API ("Hobbit" query) needs to be saved in the dedicated application's database
- ID element should be added to the JSON object representation
- There are no restrictions on allowed hosts/CORS
- Filtering and sorting needs to be done via query parameters presented in the project requirements (this explains why I did not use django-filters)
